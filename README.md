E-commerce React Vite App Backend with Express.js

Our e-commerce platform's backend is built using modern technologies like Express.js, Node.js, Mongoose, Cors, Bcrypt, and JWT to provide a robust and secure API for our React Vite frontend application. Let's delve into the key components and features of our backend system:

1. Express.js and Node.js:

    Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, making it ideal for building APIs.
   
    Node.js provides the runtime environment for our backend, allowing us to use JavaScript on the server side.

2. Mongoose:

    Mongoose is an elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

   It simplifies interactions with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution and powerful features like validation, hooks, and queries.

3. Cors (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

    Cors is middleware that enables cross-origin requests in our API, allowing our frontend to securely communicate with the backend across different domains.

4. Bcrypt:

    Bcrypt is a library used for hashing passwords securely. It ensures that user passwords are stored in a hashed format, enhancing security and protecting user data.

5. JWT (JSON Web Tokens):

    JWT is a compact and self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.

    We use JWT to implement authentication and authorization in our API, allowing users to securely access protected routes and perform actions based on their roles and permissions.
